Create a webpage which allows a user to configure a mug.  Mugs come in five different colours and have associated costs as per the description overleaf. 

The mug comes in four different sizes: 
 Small €9.99 
 Medium €12.99 
 Large €14.99 
 Extra-large €15.99 
Mugs also have four different upgrades available: 
 Transparent base €3 
 Thermos €7 
 Upload your logo €6 
 Engraved Initials €2 
Add-ons: 
 Hot plate for your mug €15 
 Mug Lid €3 
 Mug pull-cord €6 
and here are the supplier specific options: 
 1kg coffee €15 
 Condensed Milk €3 
 1000 Tea Bags €6 
When the user clicks on any of the sizes/upgrades/add-ons/supplier options, the read-only “Total Price” form field element should re-calculate the total when the “Calculate Total” button is pressed.  For example, selection of the “Medium” size mug will put €12.99 into the read-only Total Price form field when the Calculate Total button is pressed. If “Thermos” is selected, then the Total Price should update to €19.99. 
In addition, when the user changes the mug colour in the list, the picture of the mug should automatically change.  
Finally, clicking the “Order Now” button should post the form details correctly to http://atlantis.cit.ie/displayvalues.php. The “Order Now” button should only send the contents if the read-only “Total Price” field is not empty.
